It contans state-wise IMR represented on Map of India of SRS data of year 2013.

Infant Mortality is the death of young children under the age of one. This death toll is measured by the infant mortality rate (IMR), which is the number of deaths under one year of age occurring among the live births in a given geographical area during a given year, per 1,000 live births occurring among the population of the given geographical area during the same year. IMR comprises of two components (Neonatal Mortality Rate and Post NeonatalMortality Rate ). IMR depends on various differentials such as region(rural or urban), sex, interstate, etc. In India, according to SRS, the percentage of infant deaths to total deaths varies substantially across the states.

Neonatal Mortality Rate-  Neonatal Mortality Rate is the number of infant deaths of less than 29 days per thousand live births during the year.The level of Neonatal mortality is greatly affected by biological and maternal factors including nutritional status of the mother.

Post Neonatal Mortality Rate- Post Neonatal Mortality Rate is number of deaths of 29 days to less than one year per thousand live births during the year.

Perinatal mortality rate- Perinatal mortality rate is the number of fatal deaths after 28 weeks of pregnancy and infant deaths under 7 days of age in a given year per 1000 total births in that year.

This article contains the Infant Mortality Rate of india and IMR is shown on India's map, including Neonatal, Post neonatal and Perinatal mortality rate in the Year 2013.
